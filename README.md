# Simple Blog Website using Djnago
 
### I have build this simple blog website using ```Djnago``` following the tutorial series on ```YouTube``` uploaded by [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/c/Coreyms). I am just learning ```Django```. This simple project has enriched my understanding of how ```Djnago``` works.
Using this website an user can do following tasks
1. Create an account.
2. Log in to an existing account.
3. Create a post.
4. Update profile information.
5. See latest posts in **Home**.
6. Change account password with email authentication.
